                    <p>Was any quarterback playing better football last January than Josh Allen? Not a chance. He had a 149.0 passer rating and 9:0 TD-to-INT ratio in Buffalo's two playoff games. What I've seen from Allen up to this point -- on and off the field -- tells me he's ready to take the Bills to the Promised Land and win a league MVP award along the way. It helps that he has equally hungry teammates in Stefon Diggs and others, but make no mistake: The Bills are enjoying success because of Allen and his otherworldly abilities.

                    <p>Burrow led the NFL in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per attempt (8.9) last season. Impressive stuff, considering it was his first season off an ACL injury and he was sacked a whopping 70 times (including the playoffs). Burrow's swagger, toughness and ability to step up in the big moment -- combined with his athletic ability and leadership qualities -- are big reasons why the Bengals made a Super Bowl run. Could last year's Comeback Player of the Year be this year's Most Valuable Player? Burrow has a legitimate shot with his supporting cast. The fact that he isn't currently practicing after having an appendectomy shouldn't be a factor come Week 1; there's still plenty of time for him to find his groove.

                <h1 id="arod">3. Aaron Rodgers,Green Bay Packers</h1>
                 <img class="photo" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/11/12/sports/12streeter-sot1/12streeter-sot1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp">
                    <p>How do you not put the back-to-back MVP at the top of this list? Now with four league MVPs to his name, Rodgers is on an incredible run with 13 wins in each of the last three seasons. In 2021, he led the NFL in passer rating (111.9) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (37:4). The 38-year-old's at the height of his powers, with more precision, confidence and command of the offense than at any other point in his career. The individual success Rodgers has enjoyed of late feels second to none, but this season presents a whole new challenge, as he's working with an unheralded cast of receivers following Davante Adams' relocation to Las Vegas. Rodgers is adamant he wants to win another Super Bowl before he hangs up his cleats. To do that, he'll need to be as good as ever to bring the offense along. That said, I wouldn't bet against him.

                <h1 id="pat">2. Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs</h1>
                 <img class="photo" src="https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/crop_style_16_9_mobile/s3/2022-03/mahomes.jpg?h=23d4db00&itok=20-ErrQY">
                    <p>The Chiefs have fielded the NFL's No. 1 scoring and total offense since Mahomes took the starting reins in 2018, with the quarterback racking up a 49-13 record in the process. There's simply no ceiling when it comes to Mahomes' ability and where he can take this team -- even without Tyreek Hill. This fall will present a new test for the 26-year-old signal-caller, but who's going to be shocked if the Chiefs are playing in the AFC Championship Game for the fifth straight year? No one. That's who. For more info on Patrick Mahomes, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes">here.</a></p>

                <h1 id="tom">1. Tom Brady, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h1>

                    <p>That avocado ice cream is working. The 45-year-old quarterback is at the top of his game, finishing in the top three in pass attempts, yards and touchdowns in each of his two seasons with the Bucs. Watching Brady is something else. He's still throwing the ball fluidly with precision and accuracy -- and on top of that, he enters the season with the best receiving corps in the league. I don't anticipate TB12 taking a step back in 2022, even with his extended absence during the preseason. In fact, after weighing how he's looked in practice and his recent success on the field, it feels like the G.O.A.T. might just play forever.
